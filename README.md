# Installation

Install the latest release using pip:

`pip install django-search-filter-sort`

Development version can installed using `pip install git+https://github.com/Macainian/Django-Search-Filter-Sort.git`, though be
warned that I don't guarantee anything about the development version. Sometimes it is completely broken because I am
in the middle of major code changes and swapping from one machine to another.
